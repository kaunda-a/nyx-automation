# Tauri Setup Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to test the Tauri setup for the Nyx Crawler Bot application.

## Prerequisites
1. Rust and Cargo installed
2. Tauri CLI installed (`cargo install tauri-cli`)
3. Node.js and pnpm installed
4. All project dependencies installed (`pnpm install` in both client and server directories)

## Test Steps

### 1. Development Mode Test
- Run `pnpm tauri dev` in the client directory
- Verify that the Tauri window opens with the application
- Check that the frontend connects to the backend server correctly
- Test basic functionality of the application

### 2. Build Test
- Run `pnpm tauri build` in the client directory
- Verify that the build completes successfully
- Check that the appropriate binaries are generated for the target platform

### 3. Installation Test
- Install the generated application
- Verify that it starts correctly
- Test all major features of the application

## Expected Results
- The application should start without errors
- All UI elements should render correctly
- The frontend should be able to communicate with the backend
- All application features should work as expected

## Troubleshooting
- If the application fails to start, check the console for error messages
- If there are connection issues between frontend and backend, verify the server is running
- If there are build errors, ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
