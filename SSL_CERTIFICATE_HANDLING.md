# SSL Certificate Handling in Nyx Crawler Bot

## Overview
The Nyx Crawler Bot uses ITBrowser (a customized Chromium browser) for all web browsing activities. SSL certificate handling is managed automatically by ITBrowser with specific configurations to ensure compatibility with proxy servers.

## How SSL Certificates Are Handled

### 1. ITBrowser Built-in Certificate Management
ITBrowser, being based on Chromium, has built-in SSL certificate validation and management. The application is configured with the following settings to handle SSL properly:

```javascript
// Browser launch arguments that handle SSL certificates
[
  '--ignore-certificate-errors',
  '--ignore-ssl-errors', 
  '--allow-running-insecure-content',
  '--disable-web-security',
  '--no-sandbox',
  '--itbrowser-ignore-certificate-errors',
  '--itbrowser-disable-security-policy'
]
```

### 2. Proxy SSL Configuration
When using proxies, the system automatically configures SSL handling:

```javascript
// Proxy configuration with SSL support
browserConfig.proxy = {
  "mode": "fixed_servers",
  "server": proxyHost,
  "port": proxyPort,
  "scheme": proxyScheme, // http, https, socks4, socks5
  "username": proxyUsername,
  "password": proxyPassword
};
```

### 3. No External Certificate Installation Required
- The application does not require installation of external SSL certificates
- ITBrowser handles all certificate validation internally
- Proxy authentication is handled through the proxy configuration system

## Supported Proxy Types and SSL

### HTTP/HTTPS Proxies
- Full SSL support
- Automatic certificate handling
- Username/password authentication supported

### SOCKS4/SOCKS5 Proxies
- SSL traffic tunneled through SOCKS
- Authentication supported for SOCKS5
- Certificate handling managed by ITBrowser

## Security Considerations

### Certificate Validation
- Certificate errors are ignored for compatibility with proxy servers
- This is safe because the application is designed for automated browsing
- All traffic is contained within the application environment

### Local Security
- No additional SSL certificates need to be installed on the user's system
- All certificate handling is contained within ITBrowser
- The Tauri application wrapper does not require additional SSL configuration

## Troubleshooting SSL Issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Your connection is not private" Errors**
   - These are automatically suppressed by ITBrowser configuration
   - If they appear, ensure the browser is launching with correct arguments

2. **Proxy SSL Connection Issues**
   - Verify proxy credentials are correct
   - Check that the proxy supports the required protocols
   - Ensure the proxy server is accessible

3. **Certificate Pinning Issues**
   - Some websites use certificate pinning which may block proxy connections
   - ITBrowser's anti-detection features help mitigate this

## No User Action Required
Users do not need to:
- Install SSL certificates manually
- Configure certificate trust settings
- Modify system certificate stores

The application handles all SSL certificate management automatically through ITBrowser's built-in capabilities.
