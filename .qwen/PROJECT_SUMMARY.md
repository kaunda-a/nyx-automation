# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To convert the existing Nyx automation web application into a desktop application using Tauri while maintaining its custom Chrome browser functionality for anti-detection automation.

## Key Knowledge
- The project includes a custom Chrome build (`browser/chrome.exe`) and related fingerprinting tools (`browser/itbrowser_fingerprint.exe`) for enhanced anti-detection capabilities
- The frontend is a Vite + React application with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and TanStack Router
- The custom Chrome build is used by Playwright on the server-side for automation tasks
- Tauri does not support using custom Chrome executables as it relies on system WebViews (WebView2 on Windows)
- A hybrid approach is recommended: Tauri for the desktop UI communicating with the existing server-side automation backend
- Project uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json) which requires `.cjs` extension for CommonJS files
- Browser download URL: https://github.com/itbrowser-net/undetectable-fingerprint-browser/releases/download/v1.0.0/fingerprint_browser_v1.0.7z

## Recent Actions
- Implemented Tauri integration with the existing Nyx automation web application
- Set up IPC communication between the Tauri frontend and server backend
- Configured GitHub Actions workflow to download the browser from GitHub release during the build process
- Resolved git issues with large zip file by removing it from repository history
- Fixed multiple ES module compatibility issues by renaming scripts to use `.cjs` extension
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow pnpm installation issues by using pnpm/action-setup
- Successfully triggered GitHub Actions workflow with tag v1.1.1
