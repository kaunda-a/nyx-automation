# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To convert the existing Nyx automation web application into a desktop application using Tauri while maintaining its custom Chrome browser functionality for anti-detection automation.

## Key Knowledge
- The project includes a custom Chrome build (`browser/chrome.exe`) and related fingerprinting tools (`browser/itbrowser_fingerprint.exe`) for enhanced anti-detection capabilities
- The frontend is a Vite + React application with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and TanStack Router
- The custom Chrome build is used by Playwright on the server-side for automation tasks
- Tauri does not support using custom Chrome executables as it relies on system WebViews (WebView2 on Windows)
- A hybrid approach is recommended: Tauri for the desktop UI communicating with the existing server-side automation backend

## Recent Actions
- Verified the presence and purpose of the custom Chrome build and related files
- Researched Tauri integration with Vite + React projects
- Discovered that Tauri cannot use custom Chrome builds due to its architecture (uses system WebViews)
- Identified that the current architecture uses Playwright with custom browser executables for server-side automation
- Developed a plan for Tauri integration that maintains the existing server-side automation capabilities

## Current Plan
1. [TODO] Add Tauri dependencies to the client project
2. [TODO] Initialize Tauri in the project
3. [TODO] Configure Tauri to work with the existing Vite setup
4. [TODO] Set up IPC communication between Tauri frontend and server backend
5. [TODO] Test the desktop application with server-side automation
6. [TODO] Build the final desktop application
