# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To convert the existing Nyx automation web application into a desktop application using Tauri while maintaining its custom Chrome browser functionality for anti-detection automation.

## Key Knowledge
- The project includes a custom Chrome build (`browser/chrome.exe`) and related fingerprinting tools (`browser/itbrowser_fingerprint.exe`) for enhanced anti-detection capabilities
- The frontend is a Vite + React application with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and TanStack Router
- The custom Chrome build is used by Playwright on the server-side for automation tasks
- Tauri does not support using custom Chrome executables as it relies on system WebViews (WebView2 on Windows)
- A hybrid approach is recommended: Tauri for the desktop UI communicating with the existing server-side automation backend

## Recent Actions
- Verified the presence and purpose of the custom Chrome build and related files
- Researched Tauri integration with Vite + React projects
- Discovered that Tauri cannot use custom Chrome builds due to its architecture (uses system WebViews)
- Identified that the current architecture uses Playwright with custom browser executables for server-side automation
- Developed a plan for Tauri integration that maintains the existing server-side automation capabilities
- Implemented browser download from GitHub release during Tauri build process
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to download browser during build using the correct URL: https://github.com/itbrowser-net/undetectable-fingerprint-browser/releases/download/v1.0.0/fingerprint_browser_v1.0.7z
- Updated .gitignore to exclude browser files and archives
- Removed browser archive from Tauri resources
- Implemented Tauri IPC communication layer for frontend-backend communication
- Created Tauri commands for server management
- Created TypeScript library for Tauri IPC calls
- Resolved git issues with large zip file by removing it from repository history
- Fixed string escaping in download script
- Triggered GitHub Actions workflow with new tag v1.1.1
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow pnpm installation issue
- Updated tag to trigger new workflow
- Used pnpm/action-setup for cross-platform pnpm installation
- Fixed ES module compatibility issue with download scripts by renaming to .cjs extension
- Fixed ES module compatibility issue with build scripts by renaming to .cjs extension
